# Canadian Supermarket Web Scraper
This project is a web scraper and WebDriver implementation designed to extract information from major Canadian supermarkets. It currently supports scraping data from Safeway, one of the leading supermarket chains in Canada.

## Overview
The Canadian Supermarket Web Scraper is built using Python and utilizes the Selenium WebDriver library. It provides a flexible and automated way to gather data such as product names, prices, and other relevant details from the online shopping platforms of various Canadian supermarkets.

The scraper allows you to search for specific products by keywords and retrieves information from the search results. It navigates through the supermarket's website, performs searches, and extracts the desired data from the product listings.

## Features
Web Scraping: The scraper interacts with the supermarket's website using Selenium WebDriver, simulating user actions to search for products and extract information.

Dynamic Search: You can provide specific product keywords to search for, allowing you to retrieve targeted data for your desired items.

Data Extraction: The scraper extracts information such as product names and prices from the search results, enabling you to gather data for analysis or other purposes.

Modular Structure: The project is designed with a modular structure, making it easy to extend and add support for additional Canadian supermarkets in the future.
